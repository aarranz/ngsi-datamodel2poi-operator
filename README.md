# NGSI datamodel 2 PoI operator

The *NGSI datamodel 2 PoI* operator is useful for formating entities using
any of the [FIWARE Data Models](https://schema.fiware.org) to be displayed
inside any of the map widgets available for WireCloud.

## Build dependencies

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). For example, you can install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt install curl gnupg
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

You also have to install the [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)'s command line interface (CLI):

```bash
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

The remaining dependencies are installed using npm (you have to run this command
inside the folder where you downloaded this repository):

```bash
npm install
```


## Build

Once installed all the build dependencies you can build this operator by using grunt:

```bash
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.
