This operator transforms NGSI entities (as the ones coming from the NGSI source operator) using any of the available [data models from FIWARE](https://schema.fiware.org) into Points of Interest. Point of Interest is the format used by many of the map viewers provided in WireCloud (like the `ol3-map` widget).
